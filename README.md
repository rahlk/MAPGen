MAPGen: (M)ultiobjective (A)utomated (P)atch (G)enerator
===

MAPGen is a multiobjective automated patch generation and program repair toolkit built on top of GenProg.

Prequisites
---
MAPGen uses binaries from GenProg which modifies C ASTs. The source code for this is in OCAML. So, you'll definitely need to install that first. On OSX, I recommend using homebrew.

``` shell
brew install opam
```
