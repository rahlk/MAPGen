#This test runs a repair on gcd with configurations that successfully find a repair.
#Due to the random nature of search, even with the random seed held constant, future 
#changes to genprog may cause this test to fail.
#Therefore, consider this test more of a hint than a fact of nature.

# remove any old repairs and run with configuration2
